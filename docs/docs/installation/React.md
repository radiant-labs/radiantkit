# Introduction

The following guide describes how to integrate RadiantKit with your [React](https://reactjs.org/) project. We’re using [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) here, but the workflow should be similar with other setups.

## Create a project

Let’s start with a fresh React project called **my-radiantkit-project**. [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) will set up everything we need.

```
# create a project with npm
npx create-react-app my-radiantkit-project

# change directory
cd my-radiantkit-project
```

## Install the dependencies
