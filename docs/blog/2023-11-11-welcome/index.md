Welcome to **RadiantKit**, an in-development framework to build graphics applications (like Figma, Canva, Miro, etc) that's free and open source.

To get started, try these out:
1. Follow the tutorials to create a sample React project that renders an interactive canvas and provides APIs to add different nodes such as Rectangles, Images and Text (with more to come).
2. Checkout a few demos [here](https://demo.radiantkit.xyz/basic)
3. Join the Slack community [here](https://join.slack.com/t/radiantkit/shared_invite/zt-25isowtr6-jg3wHcQjRuLxyeT_fELO9Q).
4. Raise Github issues for any feature requests, bugs or suggestions.

Looking forward to making this a success!
