# Radiant

Radiant is an in-development framework to build graphics applications (like Figma, Canva, Miro, etc) that's free and open source. 

It introduces a node-component-system for efficient rendering, while ensuring complete extensibility. It can support both native and web (via WebAssmebly) platforms.

To run the dummy app, install rust and follow these steps:
2. cd main
3. cargo run
